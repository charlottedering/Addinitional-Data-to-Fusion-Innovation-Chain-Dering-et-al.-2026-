The Fusion Device Table based on FusDis version 2024.
The Fusion Device Information System (FusDIS) is the authoritative global database that systematically catalogues device configuration, operational status, and institutional affiliations of fusion experiments worldwide. It is maintained by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (IAEA 2024). The FusDis version 2024 was manually updated. Inactive firms were removed, and active firms were added to the project, to ensure completeness and accuracy. The analyses were created based on this updated table.

The selection of private fusion projects was conducted based on the Fusion Device Table based on FusDis version 2024, see Appendix C. The process comprised the following steps:
1.	Initial listing: All private fusion devices recorded in the table were identified and compiled.
2.	Geographical filtering: Companies headquartered outside of Europe and North and South America were excluded from the sample.
3.	Technological filtering: Devices employing configurations other than tokamak, laser/inertial confinement fusion, field-reversed configuration, or stellarator were removed (magnetic mirror, dense plasma focus, or pinch devices.
4.	Funding selection: The resulting dataset comprised 27 devices from 19 companies. The funding volume was first determined, after which a selection was made (see Appendix B). General Atomics was excluded from the sample, as its fusion research activities and therefore the financing could not be clearly separated from its other business operations.
